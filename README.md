# Software-Engineering

This repository holds some of my learnings during the UNSW course COMP1531: Software Engineering Fundamentals. This course was taught in Python and focused on team based software development and project management (major project), the software lifecycle, conceptual modelling and software architectures.

The group assignment is not held on my github account. My group received a HD mark for this, and I have applied what I learned from this project (Python, Flask, Jinja, SQL databases, HTML, CSS and project management skills) to other projects - specifically to AutoReporta, SmartaData and Storker - all public via my other repositories.

I received a grade of 92 in this course.
